## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) >= 22
- npm
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)
- [gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) — for pre-commit secret scanning (`brew install gitleaks` on macOS)
- [git-cliff](https://github.com/orhun/git-cliff) — for CHANGELOG generation during releases (optional, only needed by release maintainers)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nicolasluckie/pwa-soundboard.git
   cd pwa-soundboard
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This also installs Husky git hooks automatically via the `prepare` script.

3. Install Playwright browsers (for e2e tests):

   ```bash
   npx playwright install chromium
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Development Workflow

This project uses [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) for git hooks:

- **pre-commit**: Runs `lint-staged` (Prettier + ESLint on staged files) and `gitleaks` (secret detection on staged files)
- **commit-msg**: Enforces [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) via commitlint

Use `npm run commit` for an interactive Conventional Commits prompt (via Commitizen), or write commits manually following the format:

```
<type>(optional scope): <description>
```

See [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) for the full commit message spec.

---

## Testing

### Unit tests (Vitest)

```bash
npm run test:unit
```

Tests live in `client/src/test/` and run in a jsdom environment.

### End-to-end tests (Playwright)

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

Tests live in `client/src/e2e/`. Playwright auto-starts both the Express server (port 3000) and the Vite dev server (port 5173) — no need to run them separately. Only Chromium is configured.

In CI, e2e tests run against the production build served by the Express server using the `PW_SKIP_BUILD` env var.

### Coverage gate

Unit tests enforce a **70% minimum coverage** threshold across statements, branches, functions, and lines. The build fails if any metric drops below 70%.

```bash
npm run test:unit:coverage
```

### Run all tests

```bash
npm test
```

## Audio Files

The project has two audio locations:

- **`data/audio/`** — Source archive for your original audio files. This is where you keep your master copies. Not served directly by the app.
- **`client/public/samples/`** — Audio files actively served by the PWA. Copy files here from `data/audio/` or add new ones directly.

To add a sound:

1. **Via the UI** — click the "Add Sound" button, select an audio or video file, fill in the metadata (name, emoji, color, tags), and submit. The server normalizes the file to MP3 via ffmpeg and updates `samples.json` automatically.
2. **Manually** — drop an `.mp3`, `.wav`, or `.ogg` file into `client/public/samples/`, then edit `client/src/data/samples.json` to add an entry with `id`, `name`, `file`, and `color`.

A demo sound is included so the app works immediately.

## Deployment

### Docker

The project uses a base `compose.yaml` plus environment-specific overrides in `docker/`:

**Development** (build from source):

```bash
npm run docker:build
npm run docker:up
```

**Production** (pull prebuilt image from GHCR):

```bash
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f docker/compose.prod.yaml up -d
```

Set `NODE_ENV=production` in your `.env` to use the production override. The server listens on port 3000 by default. Configure via environment variables — see [`.env.example`](./.env.example) for all options.

### Environment Variables

| Variable       | Default                    | Description                                        |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `HOST`         | `127.0.0.1`                | Server bind address (`0.0.0.0` for all interfaces) |
| `PORT`         | `3000`                     | Server listen port                                 |
| `ORIGIN`       | `http://HOST:PORT`         | Public-facing origin for CSRF origin checks        |
| `NODE_ENV`     | `development`              | Deployment mode: `development` or `production`     |
| `SAMPLES_DIR`  | `client/dist/samples`      | Absolute path to audio samples directory           |
| `SAMPLES_JSON` | `SAMPLES_DIR/samples.json` | Absolute path to samples metadata file             |

### CI/CD

GitHub Actions workflows handle CI and releases:

- **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) — runs on push to `main` and PRs: lint, unit tests (with coverage + badge), build, e2e tests
- **Release** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) — builds multi-arch Docker images (amd64 + arm64), scans with Trivy, pushes to GHCR, and promotes release tags

Docker images are published to `ghcr.io/nicolasluckie/pwa-soundboard`.

### Releasing

Releases are managed via `scripts/version-bump.sh` and [git-cliff](https://github.com/orhun/git-cliff):

```bash
scripts/version-bump.sh 1.0.0
git push --follow-tags
```

This bumps `package.json`, generates `CHANGELOG.md`, and creates a `v1.0.0` tag. The release workflow handles the rest.
